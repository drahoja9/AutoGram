# Autogram

Autogram is a web based app aimed to help with education and understanding of automata and grammars
and algorithms associated with them.

## Project structure

- Frontend

- Backend


Each, frontend and backend, have their own build tools with instructions in their own folders.
They are built separately and do not depend on each other.

To learn more, please read `README`s in `frontend` and `backend` folders.

## How to run

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker-compose installed on your machine:
```
docker --version; docker-compose --version
```
2. Build the Docker images for frontend and backend and run them simultaneously:
```
docker-compose up
```
