# Autogram

Autogram is a web based app aimed to help with education and understanding of automata and grammars
and algorithms associated with them.

## Project structure

- Frontend

- Backend


Each, frontend and backend, have their own build tools with instructions in their own folders.
They are built separately and do not depend on each other. Both of them emit their build results
into the top-level `build` folder.

To learn more, please read `README`s in `frontend` and `backend` folders.
